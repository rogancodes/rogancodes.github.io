Hey there! I’m Rogan Ramesh Raj, a software engineer who loves tinkering with programming languages.
Right now, I’m exploring Ruby and uncovering its quirks.

This blog is where I share my journey, experiments, and learnings. Thanks for stopping by!

You can check out what I’m currently working on over at my [GitHub](https://github.com/rogancodes){:target="_blank"}.
Feel free to reach out to me via email at <rogangs2@gmail.com>.
